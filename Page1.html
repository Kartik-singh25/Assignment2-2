        <h2> Work from Home (pros and cons)</h2>
        <p> Due to COVID-19 pandemic, many companies allowed their employees to work from home (WFH).
            Some employees are happy with WFH option, but some are not comfortable with it. There are pros & cons with WFH option for both employees and companies.
            <br>Advantages for Employees:
            <ul>
            <li>Travel time to and from the office will be saved.</li>
            <li>They can spend more time with family. This is beneficial for many especially for parents of 
                young children.</li>
            <li>Even in modern times, women are expected to take care of home and children. With this responsibility, 
                several women are forced to leave their jobs. The rise in WFH culture is a boon for them. With this 
                more women can join in jobs again.</li>
            <li>The location will not be a barrier. Employees can get a job, even if the office is located in another 
                city.</li>
            <li>If they want to get to know their office and colleagues better, they can attend the office at regular 
                intervals like once a week.</li>
            
            <br>Disadvantages for Employees:
            <li>The line between work and home will be blurred. In general, employees leave work tensions at office and 
                come home to relax. But this opportunity will be lost and it may cause anxiety. If work and personal life 
                are not balanced well, work will extend to longer hours. This can create WFH burnout.</li>
            <li>Employees have to set up a work environment at home, which will incur extra expense. Even then, some 
                people may not focus on work due to the lack of a professional atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Some companies are giving so much work just because their employees are working from home.</li>
            <li>Teamwork is a bit difficult while working from home.</li>
            <li>Working from home from a long periods of time can hamper social and interpersonal skills.</li>
            <li>Continuously staying at home may make some people feel isolated.</li>
            <li>For some people, setting up office space at home may not be an option due to lack of extra space in the 
                home.</li>
            <li>Some jobs may require employees to be online during work hours and the continuous power supply may not be 
                available to many.</li>
            <li>It can be difficult to establish connections with new colleagues because the opportunity to meet and talk 
                with them during coffee breaks will be lost.</li></ul></p>
